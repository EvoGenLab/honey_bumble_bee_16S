R codes and data for analyzing gut microbiome of honey bees and bumble bees. Navolle Amiri, Mia Keady and HC Lim.

Code:
-	Dada2 pipeline to infer exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and assign taxonomy with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)
-	"Bee Preprocess” used to filter singletons, estimate Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) and species richness (SR), rarefy sequence depth
-	Bee_All_May2021-5-27-2022 – includes all analyses: dominant phyla, test for core bacteria, heatmap, alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, indicator species

Data files used in analyses: DNA sequences, metadata, taxonomy, feature table, bacterial DNA sequences

Other files: ASV relative abundance table, bee species sub genus
